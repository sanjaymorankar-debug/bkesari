/**
 * Cashfree server-to-server webhook (requirements §3, §4, §41).
 *
 * This is the safety net the client-invoked `/api/wallet/verify` cannot be:
 * that endpoint only fires if the customer's browser stays online long enough
 * to call it back. If it closes the tab, loses connectivity, or the checkout
 * modal simply errors, Cashfree still has the money and this webhook is the
 * only remaining path that credits the wallet.
 *
 * Security, in order:
 *  1. Read the RAW body — signature verification is over the exact bytes
 *     Cashfree sent, not a re-serialised JSON.parse/stringify round-trip.
 *  2. Verify `x-webhook-signature` (HMAC-SHA256 over `timestamp + rawBody`,
 *     keyed on CASHFREE_SECRET_KEY) BEFORE touching anything else in the
 *     payload.
 *  3. Only then parse and act on it.
 *
 * Idempotent and retry-safe by construction, not by any special-casing here:
 * `creditFromWebhook` → `finalizeVerifiedPayment` does a conditional
 * `UPDATE ... WHERE status = 'CREATED'`, so a redelivered event (Cashfree
 * retries on anything but 2xx) finds the payment already SUCCESS and returns
 * without moving money twice — the same guarantee that protects the
 * client-invoked path racing against this one.
