            {LEGAL_ENTITY.legalName} operates this marketplace, connecting
            customers with independent local shops — grocery, pharmacy,
            jewellery, dairy, bakery and every other kind of shop in their
            neighbourhood. Rather than running our own warehouse or
            fleet, we give existing local shops — the kind you&apos;d otherwise
            only find by walking past them — an online storefront, wallet
            payments, and daily subscription delivery.
          </p>

          <h2>What we do</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              List independently owned, independently operated shops after
              they&apos;re reviewed and approved by our team.
            </li>
            <li>
              Provide a platform wallet for fast repeat purchases and daily
              subscriptions (milk, bread, and other everyday essentials).
            </li>
            <li>
              Classify shops as <strong>Kesari</strong> or{" "}
              <strong>Green</strong> so customers can shop according to their
              own dietary preference at a glance.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What we are not</h2>
          <p>
            We are a marketplace, not the seller of record for most products
            listed — each shop is independently owned and responsible for its
            own products, pricing, and fulfilment, as set out in our{" "}
            <a href="/legal/seller-terms">Marketplace Seller Terms</a>. Full
            details on how orders, payments, and returns work are in our{" "}
            <a href="/legal/terms">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>.
          </p>
