# Dairy & Bakery Marketplace

A production-oriented marketplace for local dairy and bakery shops: wallet-based
payments, Kesari/Green shop classification, independent online/offline product
control, and a flexible daily subscription engine built around the daily-milk
use case.

Built from scratch. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for the design
rationale and [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for going live.

## Stack

Next.js 16 (App Router) · React 19 · TypeScript (strict) · Tailwind CSS v4 ·
PostgreSQL 16 · Drizzle ORM · Auth.js (Google OAuth) · Zod · Razorpay ·
Vitest · Playwright

> Drizzle is used instead of Prisma. The reason is documented in
> [ARCHITECTURE.md §1.1](./ARCHITECTURE.md#11-deviation-drizzle-instead-of-prisma).

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. PostgreSQL
createdb dairy_bakery
createdb dairy_bakery_test

# 2. Configure
cp .env.example .env      # then fill in the values (see below)

# 3. Schema + reference data
npm install
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed           # add --minimal for reference data only

# 4. Run
npm run dev               # http://localhost:3000
```

Sign in at `/signin`. In development an email-only form is available (disabled
in production builds); in production, Google OAuth is the only path.

The seed creates five demo shops in Pune, 18 categories and 40 products,
including one deliberately **offline-only** product (Malai Paneer at Kesari
Dairy Farm) so the online/offline rule is visible immediately.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | yes | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `TEST_DATABASE_URL` | tests | Separate database for integration tests |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | yes | Auth.js session encryption. Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `AUTH_URL` | prod | Canonical app URL, e.g. `https://bkesari.com` |
| `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID` / `AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET` | prod | Google OAuth client. Without these, Google sign-in is hidden |
| `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` / `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` | prod | Payment gateway. Without these the app runs in MOCK payment mode |
| `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | optional | Verifies Razorpay webhooks |
| `CRON_SECRET` | yes | Bearer token guarding the daily-order endpoint |
| `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAILS` | first deploy | Comma-separated emails granted ADMIN on first sign-in |
| `SUBSCRIPTION_CUTOFF_HOUR` | no | Delivery cutoff hour, default `20` |
| `APP_TIMEZONE` | no | IANA zone for delivery dates, default `Asia/Kolkata` |

An empty value (`FOO=`) is treated as unset.

## The daily order engine

Subscriptions materialise into orders through one idempotent job:

```bash
curl -X POST https://<host>/api/cron/daily-orders \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET"
```

Schedule it once daily (any scheduler works — see DEPLOYMENT.md). It is safe to
run repeatedly: a `UNIQUE(subscription_id, delivery_date)` index means a second
run for the same day is a no-op, so retries, overlapping crons and manual
replays cannot double-charge. Pass `{"date":"YYYY-MM-DD"}` to backfill a day.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Development server |
| `npm run build` / `npm start` | Production build and serve |
| `npm run db:generate` | Generate a migration from schema changes |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Apply pending migrations |
| `npm run db:seed` | Seed reference + demo data (`-- --minimal` for reference only) |
| `npm run db:studio` | Browse the database |
| `npm test` | Unit + integration tests (needs `TEST_DATABASE_URL`) |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Playwright end-to-end tests (needs a running dev server) |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript, no emit |

## Roles

| Role | Can |
|---|---|
| **Customer** | Browse, cart, order, wallet, subscriptions, daily quantity changes |
| **Shop Owner** | Register a shop, manage own products/prices/stock, receive orders, view own sales |
| **Operator** | Approve/reject shops, set Kesari/Green, manage catalogue and orders, operational reports |
| **Administrator** | Everything, plus roles, wallet adjustments, system config, audit logs |

A new Google user becomes a **Customer** with a wallet automatically. Roles are
never accepted from a request — `OPERATOR` and `ADMIN` cannot be self-assigned.
Registering a shop promotes a Customer to Shop Owner.

**Shop owners cannot change their own Kesari/Green classification.** That is
operator/admin only, and every change is recorded with who, when and why.

## Key domain rules

**Money is integer paise; quantities are integer milli-units.** `₹70.00` is
`7000`; `2 L` is `2000`. No float ever touches a monetary value, and `±0.5 L`
steps stay exact.

**A product is purchasable online only if** the shop is `APPROVED`, the offering
is active and available, online selling is enabled, an online price exists, and
stock suffices. Enforced server-side on add-to-cart, checkout and every
subscription generation — and backed by database CHECK constraints.

**Completed orders keep their price forever.** Order lines snapshot the product
name and unit price, so a later price change affects only future orders.

**Subscription schedule resolution order:** subscription live → within
start/end window → not inside a pause window → weekday is scheduled → then a
per-date override may adjust or skip it. An override never creates a delivery on
an unscheduled day, and because it is scoped to one date the schedule reverts
automatically the next day.

## Testing

```bash
npm test                                    # 80 unit + integration tests
CHROMIUM_PATH=/path/to/chrome npm run test:e2e   # 10 E2E tests, desktop + mobile
```

Integration tests run against real PostgreSQL, which is the point: the
concurrency, idempotency and constraint guarantees below cannot be proven
against a mock.

What the suite actually proves:

- Concurrent wallet debits serialise — 10 simultaneous ₹100 debits against ₹1,000 leave exactly ₹0, no lost updates
- Overdraw is impossible — 5 concurrent ₹100 debits against ₹250 yield exactly 2 successes and 3 rejections
- The ledger chain stays contiguous under 20 concurrent writes
- A replayed operation never double-charges, including 10 fired concurrently
- Forged, mismatched and cross-user payment signatures are all rejected before any credit
- Re-running the daily job (including 5 concurrent runs) creates one order and one deduction
- Skip and pause produce zero orders and zero deductions
- A price change applies to future days only; past order lines are frozen
- An insufficient balance takes no money, consumes no stock, marks the day, and can be retried after top-up
- Offline-only products cannot enter a cart or be ordered
- A shop owner cannot reclassify their own shop even with the route guard bypassed
